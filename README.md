# Exchange rate forecasting and PPP testing (Ireland and UK)

## Overview
This repository contains the final report for a time series analysis of the Ireland United Kingdom exchange rate from 2014 to 2024. The study examines Purchasing Power Parity and applies Box Jenkins ARIMA modelling to forecast the real exchange rate.

This project was completed as part of the EC6011 Business Forecasting module.

## Objectives
- Analyse nominal and real EUR GBP exchange rate behaviour
- Test absolute and relative Purchasing Power Parity
- Apply ARIMA modelling using the Box Jenkins methodology
- Generate and evaluate short term forecasts
- Interpret results in an applied economic context

## Methods
- Log transformation of exchange rate and CPI series
- Augmented Dickey Fuller tests for stationarity
- Regression based PPP testing
- ARIMA model identification using ACF and PACF
- Model selection using AIC and residual diagnostics
- 12 month forecasting

## Key findings
- Exchange rate and CPI series are non stationary in levels
- Absolute PPP shows statistical significance but weak theoretical support
- Relative PPP is not supported in this sample period
- ARIMA(0,1,0) is selected as the best forecasting model
- Forecasts are flat with increasing uncertainty


## Notes
The dataset used in this project is not included due to size and licensing restrictions. This repository focuses on documenting the analytical approach and final results.
